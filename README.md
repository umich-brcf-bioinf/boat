# Boat Project
This is a git repository as a replacement for a lightning talk about git.  The learing goal here is for everyone to practice downloading a project from github, change it and push those changes back onto github.  An accompanying file `boat.md` in this folder will have a boat in the middle.  Each person will clone the repository, add things that either fill their sails or bring them down to the boat.md document and then save and post their changes.  We will do it sequentially to avoid overwriting eachothers changes and postpone dealing with that problem till another time.  Below is the plan for Tuesday and a couple of resources for learning Git and Github.

## Before Tuesday's lab meeting:
Have git installed and configured with your username and email on your computer.  It's installed on the comps so you can use it there if you want.
You will have to sign up for a free account on https://github.com.  Please have your Github username and password ready.
We will follow this tutorial starting from the section labelled "Clone your repository to your local machine".  https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/.
