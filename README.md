# Boat Project
This is a git repository as a replacement for a lightning talk about git.  The learing goal here is for everyone to practice downloading a project from github, change it and push those changes back onto github.  An accompanying file `boat.md` in this folder will have a boat in the middle.  Each person will clone the repository, add things that either fill their sails or bring them down to the boat.md document and then save and post their changes.  We will do it sequentially to avoid overwriting eachothers changes.  Conflicting changes are something we will try to deal with at another time.  Below is the plan for Tuesday and a couple of resources for learning Git and Github.  

## Before Tuesday's lab meeting:
* Have git installed and configured with your username and email on your computer.  It's installed on the comps so you can use it there if you want.  You configuration instructions are here: https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html#hello-git. 
* You will have to sign up for a free account on https://github.com.  Please have your Github username and password ready.  
* Have an idea of what you want to put on the boat page since it will take some time for everyone to go through the process.  

## On Tuesday:  

* We will follow this tutorial starting from the section labelled "Clone your repository to your local machine".  https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/. 
* One volunteer will share their screen and go through the stems while everyone watches.  Once they have pushed their changes the next person can start with downloading the updated repository.  Don't start ahead of time or there will be conficts.  
* Everyone else will go in turn.  I guess it will take 4 minutes per person to clone, modify and push so the whole thing will take 30 minutes.  In the meantime Raymond will talk for a few minutes about some projects where he's used git and github and how it's usefull.
